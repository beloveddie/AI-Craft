            "This paper introduces a novel neural network architecture, the Transformer, designed for sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer simplifies existing models by relying solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness in machine translation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. The Transformer outperforms previous models, improving BLEU scores by a significant margin and reducing training time and costs. Additionally, the model's versatility is showcased through successful application in English constituency parsing with varying training data sizes.\n",

It achieves 28.4 BLEU on WMT 2014 English-to-German and 41.8 BLEU on English-to-French translation tasks, surpassing existing methods. The Transformer's efficiency is evident in faster training and lower costs, making it a significant contribution to neural machine translation.\n"

The Transformer simplifies existing models by relying solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness in machine translation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. The Transformer outperforms previous models, improving BLEU scores by a significant margin and reducing training time and costs. Additionally, the model's versatility is showcased through successful application in English constituency parsing with varying training data sizes.\\n\\n## Revised Summary:\\n\\nThe Transformer architecture, a new attention-based model, outperforms traditional sequence transduction models. It achieves 28.4 BLEU on WMT 2014 English-to-German and 41.8 BLEU on English-to-French translation tasks, surpassing existing methods. The Transformer's efficiency is evident in faster training and lower costs, making it a significant contribution to neural machine translation.\"},\n",

              "  'summary': '  Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) generates target translations while\\nreading the source sentence. It relies on a policy to determine the optimal\\ntiming for reading sentences and generating translations. Existing SiMT methods\\ngenerally adopt the traditional Transformer architecture, which concurrently\\ndetermines the policy and generates translations. While they excel at\\ndetermining policies, their translation performance is suboptimal. Conversely,\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive corpora, possess superior\\ngeneration capabilities, but it is difficult for them to acquire translation\\npolicy through the training methods of SiMT. Therefore, we introduce\\nAgent-SiMT, a framework combining the strengths of LLMs and traditional SiMT\\nmethods. Agent-SiMT contains the policy-decision agent and the translation\\nagent. The policy-decision agent is managed by a SiMT model, which determines\\nthe translation policy using partial source sentence and translation. The\\ntranslation agent, leveraging an LLM, generates translation based on the\\npartial source sentence. The two agents collaborate to accomplish SiMT.\\nExperiments demonstrate that Agent-SiMT attains state-of-the-art performance.\\n'},\n",

Afterwards, we provide an investigation on wildly used evaluation\\nnecessities tailored for long-context LLMs, including datasets, metrics, and\\nbaseline models, as well as optimization toolkits such as libraries,\\nframeworks, and compilers to boost the efficacy of LLMs across different stages\\nin runtime.

              "  'summary': '  Effective collaboration in multi-agent systems requires communicating goals\\nand intentions between agents. Current agent frameworks often suffer from\\ndependencies on single-agent execution and lack robust inter-module\\ncommunication, frequently leading to suboptimal multi-agent reinforcement\\nlearning (MARL) policies and inadequate task coordination. To address these\\nchallenges, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as\\ncollaborative agents to enable coordinated behaviors in cooperative MARL. Each\\nagent maintains a private intention consisting of its current goal and\\nassociated sub-tasks. Agents broadcast their intentions periodically, allowing\\nother agents to infer coordination tasks. A propagation network transforms\\nbroadcast intentions into teammate-specific communication messages, sharing\\nrelevant goals with designated teammates. The architecture of our framework is\\nstructured into planning, grounding, and execution modules. During execution,\\nmultiple agents interact in a downstream environment and communicate intentions\\nto enable coordinated behaviors. The grounding module dynamically adapts\\ncomprehension strategies based on emerging coordination patterns, while\\nfeedback from execution agents influnces the planning module, enabling the\\ndynamic re-planning of sub-tasks. Results in collaborative environment\\nsimulation demonstrate intention propagation reduces miscoordination errors by\\naligning sub-task dependencies between agents. Agents learn when to communicate\\nintentions and which teammates require task details, resulting in emergent\\ncoordinated behaviors. This demonstrates the efficacy of intention sharing for\\ncooperative multi-agent RL based on LLMs.\\n'},\n",
